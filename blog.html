       <h2>[Ecclesiates 4:10, 27/1/25]</h2>
       <p>erm excuse me, what do you mean it's only been three days since my last post. that can't be right. is the date on the post below right? it can't be. if i edit it it said 24/1/25 fyi. anyway. i'm in a bit of a tough spot right now but i wanted to do a little update for the 0 people who read it. so probably just for me to read back in the future. hi me :ca3:<br>oh yeah, that's a good idea. i should figure out how to embed emojis into my text. okay i have a project now.</p>
       <p>i picked this verse because i'm being edgy and sad and whatnot. just be glad i didn't pick the next verse okay</p>
       <p><q>Ecclesiastes 4:10, New Revised Standard Version Updated Edition<br>For if they fall, one will lift up the other, but woe to one who is alone and falls and does not have another to help.</p>
       <h2>[Ephesians 6:10-18, 24/1/25]</h2>
            <p>in the time between my last post and now, i have read the entire new testament. this was not over all of the time, rather i sat down and read it all, in sequence, in one session. it took almost exactly 9 hours. the books of Matthew, Romans, and Ephesians were absolutely stand-out to me, especially the sermon on the mount detailed in Matthew. also, after reading Tobit as i said below, i went on to read 2 Esdras, continuing in the deuterocanon. this was also excellent, and i found parts of it strangely Wittgensteinian; i suspect i'll make another post elaborating on this at some point.</p>

            <p><q>Ephesians 6:10-18, New Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition<br>Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his power. Put on the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For our struggle is not against enemies of blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to withstand on that evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. Stand therefore, and fasten the belt of truth around your waist, and put on the breastplate of righteousness. As shoes for your feet put on whatever will make you ready to proclaim the gospel of peace. With all of these, take the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Pray in the Spirit at all times in every prayer and supplication. To that end keep alert and always persevere in supplication for all the saints.</p>
       <h2>[Tobit 4:7-8, 11/1/25]</h2>
            <p>today i read the Deuterocanonical book of Tobit. i was struck by the excellence of the storytelling. it made the straight theological teachings imparted in it much more palatable, wrapped in narrative as they were. one such (and my favourite) theological teaching of the book on first reading is the title for the post today, Tobit 4:7-8. it models a behaviour which i see in the righteous around me, and aim to emulate where i can. i read the book, which is about 9700 words, at about 400 wpm for a time of around 25 minutes. it makes me wonder whether i should be reading more, or mulling over what i've already read. i think i'll aim for a book in my readings each time, as i have been doing, although obviously books vary in size.</p>
            <p>that's about all for now, i think.</p>
            <p><q>Tobit 4, New Revised Standard Version Updated Edition<br>...give alms according to your circumstances, my son, and do not turn your face away from anyone who is poor. Then the face of God will not be turned away from you. Act according to what you have, my son. If you have much, give alms from it; if you have little, give alms in accordance with what you have. Do not be afraid, my son, to give alms.</p>
       <h2>[1 john 4:8, 10/1/25]</h2>
          <p>i think maybe i like this format a little better than the substack. it's always a big writing on something importantâ„¢ on there but here i can just drop a little snippet of thought and be done with it, so that's cool.</p>
          <p>as of right now the site has two sections other than the home, and one of them is just labeled "filler" and goes nowhere. i should probably think of something to put there. and also expand the gallery every now and then.</p>
          <p>i'm enjoying mastodon. chaos.social is being treated to banger posts such as <li><a href="https://chaos.social/@boghan/113798654788823122">this</a></li>  and <li><a href="https://chaos.social/@boghan/113798513346081766">this</a></li></p>
          <p>i wonder if i should add hidden sections of the site with exclusive content. or maybe they already exist. i mean haha what was i saying you didn't hear anything</p>

       <h2>[romans 3:23, 9/1/25]</h2>
          <p>this is the first blog post, i suppose</p>
          <p>it's a little different than other stuff i've done before, like the substack. there are a lot of comfort features on there, and i tend to have a specific topic or event to talk about. here i'm just typing in a html file and then pushing it to the github page. but that's alright. it's not perfect (romans 3:23) but maybe it will be something to look back on in the future. also i'm going to try to pick out a bible verse for each post because it's an interesting motif<p>
          <p>i think that's all for this first post. hopefully more to come.<p>
