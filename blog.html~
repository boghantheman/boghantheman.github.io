       <h2>[romans 3:23, 9/1/25]</h2>
          <p>this is the first blog post, i suppose</p>
          <p>it's a little different than other stuff i've done before, like the substack. there are a lot of comfort features on there, and i tend to have a specific topic or event to talk about. here i'm just typing in a html file and then pushing it to the github page. but that's alright. it's not perfect (romans 3:23) but maybe it will be something to look back on in the future. also i'm going to try to pick out a bible verse for each post because it's an interesting motif<p>
          <p>i think that's all for this first post. hopefully more to come.<p>
