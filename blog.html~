       <h2>[Tobit 4:7-8, 11/1/25]</h2>
            <p>today i read the Deuterocanonical book of Tobit. i was struck by the excellence of the storytelling. it made the straight theological teachings imparted in it much more palatable, wrapped in narrative as they were. one such (and my favourite) theological teaching of the book on first reading is the title for the post today, Tobit 4:7-8. i read the book, which is about 9700 words, at about 400 wpm for a time of around 25 minutes. it makes me wonder whether i should be reading more, or mulling over what i've already read. i think i'll aim for a book in my readings each time, as i have been doing, although obviously books vary in size.</p>
            <p>that's about all for now, i think.</p>
            <p><q>Tobit 4, New Revised Standard Version Updated Edition<br>...give alms according to your circumstances, my son, and do not turn your face away from anyone who is poor. Then the face of God will not be turned away from you. Act according to what you have, my son. If you have much, give alms from it; if you have little, give alms in accordance with what you have. Do not be afraid, my son, to give alms.</p>
       <h2>[1 john 4:8, 10/1/25]</h2>
          <p>i think maybe i like this format a little better than the substack. it's always a big writing on something importantâ„¢ on there but here i can just drop a little snippet of thought and be done with it, so that's cool.</p>
          <p>as of right now the site has two sections other than the home, and one of them is just labeled "filler" and goes nowhere. i should probably think of something to put there. and also expand the gallery every now and then.</p>
          <p>i'm enjoying mastodon. chaos.social is being treated to banger posts such as <li><a href="https://chaos.social/@boghan/113798654788823122">this</a></li>  and <li><a href="https://chaos.social/@boghan/113798513346081766">this</a></li></p>
          <p>i wonder if i should add hidden sections of the site with exclusive content. or maybe they already exist. i mean haha what was i saying you didn't hear anything</p>

       <h2>[romans 3:23, 9/1/25]</h2>
          <p>this is the first blog post, i suppose</p>
          <p>it's a little different than other stuff i've done before, like the substack. there are a lot of comfort features on there, and i tend to have a specific topic or event to talk about. here i'm just typing in a html file and then pushing it to the github page. but that's alright. it's not perfect (romans 3:23) but maybe it will be something to look back on in the future. also i'm going to try to pick out a bible verse for each post because it's an interesting motif<p>
          <p>i think that's all for this first post. hopefully more to come.<p>
